### lecture 2: Listening to Events & Working with Event Handlers

---

- On all built-in HTML elements we have full access to all native DOM events. You can find information about DOM events that an element supports in MDN site.

- If and element supports and event, then you can add a listener: on + event name prop (start with capital leter).

- Event handler function naming convention: event name + Handlder.

- Change the code somehow that by clicking a button it prints "Clicked" on the console?
